I have completed my MCA in 2014 and started my carrier as front-end developer, Due to sound interested in JavaScript development I have learned AngularJs version 1 and get 1.5+ experienced in it. Now past few month I am using Angular version 4 and I have developed 2 apps.

BL apps has been developed for real estate users. In this apps there are 3 users available, Agent, Customer and Admin. After successful signup Customer could add his/her properties information for the purpose of sale or buy. Same as after Successful signup and payment verification agent can bid on customer properties, Customer can choose agent as winner from his/her bided property. Selected agent can proceed when he/she can paid. In this app admin have managed both users, properties, notifications and profiles.
